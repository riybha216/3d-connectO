# About the Project

3D ConnectO is a fast-paced, two-player game where players compete to connect a specified number of pieces on a 3D board. As the board is created in 2.5D, meaning that the board is an isometric projection, players can connect the number of pieces on a singular grid horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or across multiple grids in the same fashion. The game features 3D pieces, a realistic visualization of pieces being placed on their respective boards, a 2D map to better visualize open spaces to place tokens, and an exciting twist: users can pop out any piece from the bottom grid, allowing the game to take an unexpected turn!

# How to Run

Ensure that ```main.py```, ```createObjects.py```, ```cmu_112_graphics.py```, and ```winDetection.py``` are in the same folder. Then, run ```main.py``` to run the main application. An application window should appear upon running.

# Libraries

External libraries outside of what we used in class were not utilized. Libraries needed include ```copy``` and ```random```.

# Shortcut Comamnds

No shortcut commands exist. To begin, choose a level to play. Then, to place a piece, click any grid square on topmost grid. To pop out a piece, click the piece that you wish to pop out.
